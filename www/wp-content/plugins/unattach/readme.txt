Allows detaching images and other media from posts, pages and other content types.

== Description ==

Unattach is a very simple plugin which allows detaching images and other media from WordPress posts, pages and other content types.

As of WordPress 3.1, the only way to detach a media item from a post is to delete either the post or the media item. This plugin solves that adding a 'Unattach' link below each media file in the Media Library admin view.
